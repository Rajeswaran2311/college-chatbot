# College-Related Query Chatbot

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a chatbot that can assist users with college-related queries. The chatbot is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques with NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), machine learning algorithms, and Flask for creating a web interface.

## Features
- Answering college-related queries such as admission procedures, course details, campus facilities, etc.
- Natural language understanding and processing using NLTK.
- Machine learning algorithms for intent recognition and response generation.
- Web interface for interacting with the chatbot.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Flask
